# About Simple_Tic_Tac_Toe_Java
This project is about how to create the simple game Tic-Tac-Toe with console interface. 
It contains 5 stages that I went through to create this game.
1. What's up on the battle field
2. Welcome to the battle field
3. The user is the gamemaster
4. First move
5. Fight!
Each stage has certain tasks that I have to complete (and I did).

Thank you for reading.
Best regards, Letzter Mensch.
